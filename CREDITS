	This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
	contributed (directly or indirectly) to the success of Kuraddo 
	project.  It is sorted by name and formatted to allow easy 
	grepping and beautification by scripts.  The fields are: 
	name (N), email (E), web-address (W), PGP key ID and 
	fingerprint (P), description (D), and snail-mail address (S).
	Thanks,
