	This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
	contributed to the success of Kuraddo project.  It is sorted 
  by name and formatted to allow easy grepping and beautification 
  by scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address
	(W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D), and
	snail-mail address (S).
	Thanks,
